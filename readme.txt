The rules for the compiler

The compiler is an executable file in the folder compiler. Nothing needs to be installed.
A file called inputFile.txt needs to be created in the same folder as the compiler so that the compiler
can find it. Once run, the compiler creates a scanner output with line numbers, a parser error page, an assemblyCode page,
and a symbolTable output.

The rules for the language

All variables need to be declared.
Only integers can have maths done on them.
Integers and booleans can be compared for equality
Strings can be output

Three data types:
Integer, called integer
Boolean, called logical
String, called string

Assignments are declared with a :=
There are no increment shorthands (++, --)
And and or operators are "and", or "or"
Comparison operators are a single '='
All if's need to be followed with a then
All while's with a do
Code blocks start with a "begin" and end with an "end"
The program starts with a "begin" and ends with an "end."
The language is not case sensitive
The language is not space sensitive
Each command ends with a ';'
Comments start with the word comment and end with the end of line
If comparisons and while comparisons don't need to be in parentheses
There are no brackets
There are no arrays
There are no floats

Operations are: begin, if, comment, end, then, while, do, integer, string, logical, true, false, div, or,
and, read, write, writeline

Have fun!
